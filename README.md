 **Problem Analysis**

The goal of this project is to build a website that teaches the concepts of machine learning. The website should be easy to use and understand, and it should provide users with a variety of resources to help them learn about machine learning.

**Design**

The website will be built using Flask, a Python web framework. The following HTML files will be used:

* `index.html`: This file will be the home page of the website. It will provide an overview of the website and links to the different resources available.
* `about.html`: This file will provide information about the website and its creators.
* `tutorials.html`: This file will provide a list of tutorials that users can follow to learn about machine learning.
* `resources.html`: This file will provide a list of resources that users can use to learn more about machine learning.
* `contact.html`: This file will provide a way for users to contact the website creators.

The following routes will be used:

* `/`: This route will render the `index.html` file.
* `/about`: This route will render the `about.html` file.
* `/tutorials`: This route will render the `tutorials.html` file.
* `/resources`: This route will render the `resources.html` file.
* `/contact`: This route will render the `contact.html` file.

**Implementation**

The website will be implemented using Python and Flask. The following code will be used to create the routes:

```python
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return render_template('about.html')

@app.route('/tutorials')
def tutorials():
    return render_template('tutorials.html')

@app.route('/resources')
def resources():
    return render_template('resources.html')

@app.route('/contact')
def contact():
    return render_template('contact.html')
```

The website will be hosted on a web server. Users will be able to access the website by typing the website's URL into their web browser.

**Testing**

The website will be tested to ensure that it is working properly. The following tests will be performed:

* The website will be tested to ensure that it is loading properly.
* The website will be tested to ensure that the links are working properly.
* The website will be tested to ensure that the forms are working properly.

**Deployment**

The website will be deployed to a web server. The website will be available to users 24/7.
